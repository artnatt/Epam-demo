Paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for?
Could someone tell me please?

The good news is, she can't have babies
And wont accept gifts from me
What are they for?
They'll just grow up, and break the laws you've loved

Take off your disguise
I know that underneath
It's me

Useless device, it won't suffice
I want a new game to play
When I am gone
It won't be long, before I disturb you in the dark

And paradise comes at a price
That I am not prepared to pay
What were we built for?
Will someone tell me please?

Take off your disguise
I know that underneath
It's me
